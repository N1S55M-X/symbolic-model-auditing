# symbolic-law-discovery
Automated discovery of interpretable mathematical laws from data using Symbolic Regression. Instead of fitting black-box models with millions of hidden parameters, this project leverages PySR’s evolutionary search engine to identify the simplest equations that best explain observed data, enabling transparent and scientifically meaningful modeling.
